DPOMS is an OEM tracking system for products that are developed, shipped out and to further track them through the field with various configurations with clients.

Current Config:
Fedora, msyql, rvm and greendog99's rails template as of June, 2011.
Simple layout with all the current elements listed in a simple form.


TO DO:
Need to branch out several components for one to many / belongs to associations:
- company
- contacts
- shipped versions needs to be expanded
- current versions and update dates needs to be filled in.  this is critical and very possible since each version update is controlled and not left to the end user/client to perform.
- add another field for system type (to support various hardware platforms)
